# Starcraft Bot
A basic bot for the game Starcraft II. Initially, in-game choices were selected randomly. After collecting over 3000 samples of full game data where the end result was a victory, I trained it with a CNN with 3 hidden layers. Done using keras.

End results currently: 70% winrate over HARD difficulty A.I.

In order to run this, it is required to have the sc2 game, sc2 python api, and my trained model.
